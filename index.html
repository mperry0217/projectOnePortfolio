        <p>i'm a student designer with a concentration on ux/ui design, and a former illustrative character designer. while my capacity for creativity has been under repair since starting upper division classes and beginnin some psych meds, i am developing the hard skills to be able to perform in the job market in the meantime. i hope to be able to work with people in a collaborative environment and support designers in the future. i am not sure what opportunities will arise for me in the future but i am hoping to be able to break into the market and potentially go abroad in the future.</p>
