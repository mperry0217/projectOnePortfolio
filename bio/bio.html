        <p>Monica Perry is a student designer based in San Francisco with a concentration on UX/UI design. She is still learning the basics and finding her footing in the subject, but she is very hopeful for her future in UX/UI!
        <br>
        Monica is a creative and culturally sensitive designer. Her hobbies include illustration, character design, studying languages, and sleeping. She has spent a lifetime learning how to be in tune with others who share a different cultural mindset from her and excels in spaces of cultural collaboration. She hopes to one day find work abroad and expand her cultural vocabulary endlessly.
        <br>
        While she is still a student, she is looking for her opportunity to break into the market and start out as a Junior UX/UI designer, with hopes to have a positive influence on usersâ€™ experiences with their daily products. She is learning more and more every day about user-centered design and how to better accommodate the user and make a product accessible to all.
