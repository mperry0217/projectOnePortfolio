            Lily Hoang-Zhu (aka liliuhms)

        <a src="https://liliuhms.com/"><img src="img/portfolio.png" width="35em" alt="profile logo"></a>
            <p>My first inspiration is an artist named Lily Hoang-Zhu,<br>
            also known as liliuhms on social media. She is a freelance <br>
            illustrator and designer who illustrates for children's<br>
            books and produces merchandise for her small business. She<br>
            is always creating and putting out new ideas for her store,<br>
            always exploring new ways to make art, always striving to<br>
            enjoy the work she does.</p> <br>

        <h2>
            Jae Jun Kim
        </h2>
        <a src="https://www.instagram.com/jae_jun_kim/"><img src="img/instagram.png" width="50em" alt="instagram logo"></a>
            <p>Another inspiration for me is a designer named Jae Jun Kim. <br>
            He is the first designer who works in UX/UI who I've discovered <br>
            and been able to follow to see their works. He used to have a <br>
            cool website but I can't find it anymore. He does branding and <br>
            graphic design work as well but my primary interest in him is <br>
            his high-end luxury design for websites. That being said, the <br>
            only works I can find currently are in his highlights on Instagram, <br>
            as his portfolio site may be under repair.</p> <br>
                <img src="img/jaejunkim.png" alt="the layout of Jae Jun Kim's instagram oage, featuring his three most recent posts as of September 8th, 2024, his profile icon, and seven highlights" width="100%">

                <br>
        <h2>
            Zion.T
        </h2>
        <a src="https://www.instagram.com/ziont/"><img src="img/instagram.png" width="50em" alt="instagram logo"></a>
            <p>My last inspiration is a korean musical artist by the <br>
            name of Zion.T (not associated with Zionism). He's a rnb <br>
            and pop artist with a unique style I really enjoy. He doesn't <br>
            have a website and his Instagram is malfunctioning for me but <br>
            I will link it here regardless.</p> <br>
                <img src="img/ziont.png" alt="the layout of Zion.T's Instagram page, featuring his top six most recent posts as of September 8th, 2024, and profile icon" width="100%">
