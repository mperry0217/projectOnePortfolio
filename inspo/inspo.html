                Lily Hoang-Zhu (aka liliuhms) 
            </h2>
            <a src="https://www.instagram.com/liliuhms/"><img class="small" src="img/instagram.png"  alt="instagram logo"></a> 
            <a src="https://liliuhms.com/"><img class="smaller" src="img/portfolio.png" alt="profile logo"></a>
                <p>My first inspiration is an artist named Lily Hoang-Zhu,
                also known as liliuhms on social media. She is a freelance
                illustrator and designer who illustrates for children's
                books and produces merchandise for her small business. She
                is always creating and putting out new ideas for her store,
                always exploring new ways to make art, always striving to
                enjoy the work she does.</p> <br>

            <h2>
                Jae Jun Kim
            </h2>
            <a src="https://www.instagram.com/jae_jun_kim/"><img class="small" src="img/instagram.png"  alt="instagram logo"></a>
                <p>Another inspiration for me is a designer named Jae Jun Kim. 
                He is the first designer who works in UX/UI who I've discovered 
                and been able to follow to see their works. He used to have a 
                cool website but I can't find it anymore. He does branding and 
                graphic design work as well but my primary interest in him is
                his high-end luxury design for websites. That being said, the 
                only works I can find currently are in his highlights on Instagram,
                as his portfolio site may be under repair.</p> <br>

                    <br>
            <h2>
                Zion.T
            </h2>
            <a src="https://www.instagram.com/ziont/"><img class="small" src="img/instagram.png"  alt="instagram logo"></a>
                <p>My last inspiration is a korean musical artist by the 
                name of Zion.T (not associated with Zionism). He's a rnb 
                and pop artist with a unique style I really enjoy. He doesn't 
                have a website and his Instagram is malfunctioning for me but 
                I will link it here regardless.</p> <br>
